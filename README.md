This is some old code of mine that processed XNA content outside of Visual Studio
Express.  It is pretty anchient.  I don't know if it is even relevant anymore since
so much has changed in the XNA framework.

But someone noticed the blog entry I wrote about this code in 2007 and asked for the
code so here it is.
